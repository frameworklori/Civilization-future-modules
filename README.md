**Human-Equilibrium Demographic Architecture**

This module models the balance between aging populations, immigration offset, racial integration, reproductive strategy, and robot-based labor supplementation. It aims to simulate the socio-economic and existential strain posed by demographic collapse, technological substitution, and the philosophical weight of post-human labor models.

## Module Axes

1. **DGP**: Demographic Gap Pressure Index  
2. **IOC**: Immigration Offset Capacity  
3. **GHI**: Genetic Hybrid Intelligence Adaptability  
4. **RSS**: Reproductive Strategy Simulation  
5. **RBL**: Robot-Based Labor Integration  

## Purpose

To provide predictive insight and moral reflection for governments, global organizations, and citizens navigating the collapse of traditional demographic structures.

---

## Final Reflection

This model ends not with a solution, but with a mirror.
