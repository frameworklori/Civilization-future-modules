# LORI–HEDA: Human–Environment Demographic Adaptation

This is a structural overview of the five submodules that compose the HEDA (Human–Environment Demographic Adaptation) model.  
The HEDA framework addresses the intersection of demographic collapse, reproductive strategy design, robotic labor integration, and hybrid intelligence potentials.

## Five Core Axes

### [DGP: Demographic Gap Pressure](DGP.md)
Analyzes aging societies, fertility decline, and imbalanced generational ratios.

### [IOC: Immigration Offset Capacity](IOC.md)
Examines how immigration policies can balance labor shortages and cultural integration thresholds.

### [GHI: Genetic Hybrid Intelligence](GHI.md)
Explores mixed lineage adaptation and the emergence of hybrid cognitive traits.

### [RSS: Reproduction Strategy Simulation](RSS.md)
Models long-term reproductive behavior shifts under economic and technological stressors.

### [RBL: Robot-Based Labor Integration](RBL.md)
Assesses how robotic labor can supplement or replace human labor across sectors.

## Purpose

HEDA is not a static model, but a thinking structure for future civilization adaptation.  
It asks:

> What remains of us, when labor is no longer needed and intelligence is no longer human?
