# GHI: Genetic Hybrid Intelligence

## Overview
GHI models the adaptability, intelligence diversity, and social resilience of children from mixed ethnic or cultural lineages in future demographic structures.

## Key Metrics
- Adaptability Quotient (AQ)
- Cognitive Diversity Spread (CDS)
- Bicultural Resilience Index (BRI)

## Research Questions
- Are hybrid offspring more resilient to societal change?
- Does mixed heritage improve learning flexibility or trigger social marginalization?
- How does public policy treat hybrid identity in education, healthcare, and national narratives?
