# DGP: Demographic Gap Pressure

## Overview
Demographic Gap Pressure (DGP) represents the increasing strain placed on younger generations as the elderly population grows and birth rates decline.

## Key Indicators
- Aging Acceleration Rate (AAR)
- Youth Burden Index (YBI)
- Dependency Ratio (elderly/non-elderly)

## Questions for Simulation
- What threshold of aging renders pension systems unsustainable?
- How does generational pressure affect fertility willingness?
- Can technological support reduce DGP, or only postpone collapse?
