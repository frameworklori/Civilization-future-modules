# RBL: Robot-Based Labor Integration

## Overview
RBL evaluates how robots can supplement or replace human labor, and the social risks of rapid automation.

## Core Parameters
- Robotic Substitution Ratio (RSR)
- Human Dignity Retention Score (HDRS)
- Sectoral Automation Index (SAI)

## Ethical Thresholds
- What is the minimum human labor ratio for cultural continuity?
- Can robots coexist without eroding identity, meaning, or cohesion?
- Who controls the off-switch?
