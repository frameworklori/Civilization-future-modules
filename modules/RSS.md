# RSS: Reproduction Strategy Simulation

## Overview
RSS simulates strategic fertility pathways in response to societal pressure: mass fertility vs. high-intelligence reproductive targeting.

## Comparative Routes
- Quantity Strategy: high-birth incentives, childcare subsidies, pro-family norms
- Quality Strategy: AI-guided pair matching, cognitive inheritance focus, selective incentivization

## Policy Probes
- Which strategy ensures long-term economic survivability?
- Is "smart birth" ethically viable or eugenic in disguise?
- Should governments even intervene?
